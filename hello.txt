The ARM issues below have been assigned to you (see the attached file).
Please, based on the allocation of the these issues, let us work to complete the assigned issues before the end of June. 
If you need clarifications, please see me, Utsu, or Lekwauwa.
Let us work with more sense of urgency as we are already half way through 2018 and we still have a number of outstanding issues with clients. We appreciate the efforts of everybody so far, but we need to move much faster. 
Thanks.
